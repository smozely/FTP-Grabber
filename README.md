FTP-Grabber
===========

WORK IN PROGRESS
===========

Simple tool for getting new files off a FTP site, allows for providing names and extensions to not download, also a file backed store to not download the same file if it has been removed from the target.

TODO
- Tests
- Docs
- Parallel Downloads
- Ability to kick off downstream processes after the sync is complete i.e. use this tool as part of a pipeline.
